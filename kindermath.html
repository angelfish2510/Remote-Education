       <h4>Measurement</h4>
        From Ms. Reddekopp: Last week we measured pipe cleaners, cut to different lengths, against each other. You may try an activity like this at home. You might gather items from around the house.
          <ul class="ul-interests">
              <li>Invite your child to choose two of the objects. Ask them to predict which one is longer/shorter. Invite them to find out for sure. Hopefully your child will line them up. If not, try to lead them towards doing it.</li>
              <li>Try not to just tell them what they need to do. The terms that will come up are the same, shorter and longer.</li>
              <li>Next use three objects. Have your child figure out which is the longest and which is the shortest.</li>
              <li>A writing extension for this activity can be to have your child label the objects as the same, shorter, longer. shortest and longest. You may use sticky notes or small pieces of paper.                </li>
          </ul>

        <h4>Graphing</h4>
          From Ms. Reddekopp: Gather socks of different colors. Invite your child to create a sock color "graph" on the ground. Ask your child to make observations about the graph or you may ask the following questions:
            <ul class="ul-interests">
                <li>Which one has the most?</li>
                <li>Which one has the fewest?</li>
                <li>How many more ________ are there than____________? If this question is challenging, you can ask them how many more_______________ would there need to be for that color to catch up with_______________________?
                </li>
            </Ul>  

        <h4>Addition Number Sentences</h4>
        From Ms. Reddekopp: Invite your child to make two groups of stickers or pictures and then create number sentence to go with them. They might draw five butterflies and then add two more. Next they will write 5+2=7 or 7=5+2.
          <ul class="ul-bilingual">
              <li>You can use stickers, bandaids, puff balls, q-tips, etc.</li>
              <li>Use different mediums to incorporate art and make it different each time you do it (paint, marker, glue + glitter, etc.)</li>
          </ul>
