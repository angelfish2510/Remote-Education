          <h4>Independence Badge</h4>
          <p>The badge requirements:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Get Transportation Smart - Pick ONE of these activities.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Get a bike ready to ride - put air in the tire, check the brakes, oil, etc. If you take a bike to get maintenance, you could ask the technician to talk through the maintenance with your daughter.</li>
                  <li>Help take care of a car - (We will do this one) Learn about the lights and gauges on the dashboard, check the oil, windshield washing fluid. Have a parent step on the brake - check the brake lights, turn signals and headlights.</li>  
                  <li>Use public transportation (But not right now!!) Learn how to use the trimet website to map a trip and take it.</li>
                </ul>
              <li>Make your clothes look great. - Pick ONE of these activities</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Become a laundry expert. Learn about separating laundry and different types of fabrics that require different care. Learn to remove a stain.  Be your family's helper and do three or more loads for practice.</li>
                  <li>Learn two basic sewing skills - Learn to thread a needle, do a basic stitch, a whip stitch and sew on a button.  You can take a couple of pieces of fabric squares - do one stitch along one side, the other on the other side and sew a button in the middle. Whip stitch could also be used to sew a badge on a girl's uniform.</li>            
                  <li>Be a clothes organization guru.</li>
                  <li>Watch an episode of Marie Kando and then organize your closet! Ok - the episode wasn't in the Girl Scout book, but the girls might learn from it.  Organize your closet or dresser. You might sort by color or length, make a shoe rack, use labeled clear plastic boxes or shoe boxes to hold different items or accessories.  Parent note: Learn how to say thank you and give stuff away or sell it on craigslist or facebook marketplace to earn money!</li>
                </ul>
              <li>Break a bad habit - See link below for a good framework.  - Just pick ONE habit and work on it over the next few weeks. Commit it to writing at a minimum and talk about it frequently.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>At school - putting homework off to the last minute, forgetting to study for a quiz, forgetting schoolwork at home.</li>
                  <li>At home - forgetting to brush teeth, not putting away your clothes, arguing with siblings.</li>            
                  <li>Be a clothes organization guru.</li>
                  <li>With your friends - being bossy with your friends, talking too much about yourself, interrupting.</li>
                </ul>
               <p>If they do this, it'd be great if they can share what they did at a meeting.  (You could turn this into a writing exercise -  How To break... or Why I want to... or similar)</p>
            
              <li>Help around the house.</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Solve a pesky plumbing problem. Sink plugged? Have your daughter help you disassemble and clean the U trap.  Test a smoke alarm and replace batteries. Hang something up. Figure out which type of fastener is best for the wall. Measure, etc.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Pick something that fulfills this requirement - these are just examples. I think assembling furniture, cleaning the fridge, all counts!</p>
            
              <li>Show off your independence - Pick ONE</li>
                <ul>
                  <li>Stay home alone for a few hours. </li>
                  <li>Run a family errand  - Make a grocery list, do the shopping while you are somewhere nearby.</li>
                  <li> -Go out with a friend - go to a movie or eat a meal. Sit at your own table and pay the bill. (I let my kids order their own milkshakes once and they came back with a large!)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Option 1 sounds like a good one right now!</p>              
          </ol>
