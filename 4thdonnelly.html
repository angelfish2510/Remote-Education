        <h2>General Reading & Writing</h2>
        <p class=b-interests>For reading, we are reading historical novels and students can find facts about historical figures from marginalized groups.  In other words, we are searching for interesting information about people who have made a different in the world, but are under recognized. They need to read a novel about that person.  Students may read as many novels as they wish about as many historical figures they wish.  Our writing activity is to find quotes from these people that are significant to the reason this person changed the world and our lives.  Students can write down facts and quotes to share with each other when we return to school.
          <br>Lastly, for writing, I have sent a template for our next writing activity with the homework packet.  It is to write about a historical figure you would like to meet.
          <br>Students need to describe this person, describe the setting where they would meet you, and write the conversation that you would have with that person.  An illustration with the student and the person will finish this project.  Again, we will share this with each other when we return to class.
          <br>Some students asked if they could write, instead, as if they are that historical person and write a story about that.  I have agreed to allow this to replace the above assignment.  Please let me know if you have any questions about my expectations and if I can help you get through these next fews weeks, via email, with as consistent a routine as possible.  As for me, I am staying home with my husband and we are planning our own routines, reading, playing piano and violin, learning language on duolingo, and crafting.  I hope you are all well and staying busy.  I will miss my class over the next few weeks and look forward to when this is all over.

        <h2>Links & Schedule From Ms. Donnelly</h2>
        <p class=b-interests>General Donnelly classroom schedule.</p>
        <ul class="ul-interests">
          <li><a href="http://www.amazingeducationalresources.com/ ">Amazing Educational Resources</a></li>
            <p>Math 9-10  Work on online math from the resources I have sent through group email.  It is here.  Go to the second column and click on fourth grade.  Work on IXL for geometry and measurement.  Also, students may work on problems using multiplication and division algorythm. They can choose what to work on, because there are limitless acitivites for him to work on, online.</p>
          <br>
            <p>10:00-10:20  Next is some times outside in the sun for fresh air.</p>
          <br>
            <p>10:25-11:30 Spelling Students can look for spelling words from a dictionary or webster.com These words should be words they are not familiar with and write a sentence for each word.  You may have them practice spelling these words every day and on Friday they can have a spelling test.</p>
          <br>
            <p>12:30-1:30  Reading - They can go to newsela.com for reading or scholastic.com .  If they go to newsela, you need to have them read about historical people.  I would suggest that student do not read current events, due to what is happening now.  Or, they can choose to read a book, either an historical novel or novel of choice at their reading level.</p>
          <br>
            <p>1:20-1:30 Writing - They can begin a writing piece as if they are meeting a historical person of interest.  I have introduced this in class.  They needs to write a paragraph for each of the following: 
              <br>Paragraph 1)  Who would you like to meet?  Describe the person.
              <br>Paragraph 2)  Where would you be?  Describe the setting.
              <br>Paragraph 3)  What would you say to this person?  Describe your conversation, using correct dialogue and dialogue blocking.  
              <br>End your writing piece with a satisfying conclusion.</p>
          <br>
            <p>1:30-2:30-- Choose an activity to complete, a craft, learn a new skill, anything not online.  Choose to do this outside in the sun, such as gardening or other interesting activity. They can build or make somethinng he is interested in.  They can do a simple science project.</p>
          <br>
          <br>
            <p>With this schedule, I believe students will keep on track for focused learning at the fourth grade level.  
              <br>If you need further resoruces, please let me know.
              <br>These are the resources from the district as helpful for finding literacy learnings.
