          <p><b>Dear Parents,</b><br>

            Please remind your child that the most important thing right now in regards to their music lessons is to play. It's important for us as teachers to challenge students but at the same time it is a balance between learning and enjoying their music. Help them find their comfort zone in terms of where THEY are in the book and encourage them to work from there. 
            
            <br><b>Band Karate Belts:</b>
            <br>The Band karate belt songs are good bench marks for students that can motivate them. Assure them that they will receive their belts for their accomplishments. I have students sending me video clips of them playing or shall I say "testing" for their belts. ALL teachers would appreciate this and we will keep track of their belts. This would also help us be able to evaluate how they are doing and give them some direct feedback. We are here to help. Please talk to your child about this. If they don't feel comfortable video taping or you dont have the capabilities to do this, don't worry.  Just keep them playing. This is what is most important. 
            
            <br><b>Beginning Band Assignment:</b>
            
            <br>I am going to simplify. Please read what I have written above. Saying all of that, I am referring you to our Youtube channel for M.U.S.E. so you can select whatever Lesson your child is in. I also recommend the speed drills. 
            
            <br>Many of the students have been focusing on their belt songs (Kum Ba Yah and Yankee Doodle).

          <h3>April 09, 2020</h3>
  <p>Dear Parents and Musicians,</p>

  <p>After reflecting and receiving some feedback I think the best plan is for me to hold google hangout sessions so I am available to not only give our musicians some instruction, but be available for a Q&A session if needed. Mr. Allard has been great at providing some lessons but I understand that these might not cater to all students at a particular point in their own lesson. I think it would be best to go over a few things in the lessons we are currently on and give some goals week to week. Mr. Allard's lessons can be used as they are or just as a reference- still effective resources. We of course can't play all together, but after I have gone over a couple of lesson items and Q&A, we could open it up for students to play solos for fun just so I can hear how you are doing and hear what you have been working on. We can also come up with a creative way to do belts for beginners. I can't give you the belt you earn, but you can sure be proud of yourself for the accomplishment. Maybe some sort of virtual belt - We'll see. As far as any musician that needs individual assistance we can set that up anytime. Just let me know and we'll coordinate a time.<br>
  
  So, this week you will receive a link to join a google meet or hangout with me - one for beginning classes and one for Int/Adv classes We won't go an entire 50min but I will make sure that your questions are answered and some instruction provided on the material. If it goes 50 min then that's fine. I just need to be ready to move onto my next meeting in time. You will need to use your chrome browser.<br>
  
  I will send out the meeting links and times and I will also prepare a google form that will help me know who is practicing and participating. The form will be due each Friday. There will be a point system involved with a reward for those showing participation. I will also provide a weekly lesson plan to coincide with the video lessons that Mr. Allard is doing.<br>
  
  Here are a few links I will introduce. Feel free to check them out and play around with them:<br>
  <ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.musicteachers.co.uk/namethatnote/" target="_blank">Note Name Game</a> - Fun game for learning to read the notes on the staff</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.musictheory.net/lessons" target="_blank">Music Theory Reinforcement</a> - Look at the Basic lessons on this page to reinforce the theory we have learned to date.</li>
  <li><a href="https://vicfirth.zildjian.com/education/norm-weinberg-webrhythms.html" target="_blank">Along Rhythm</a> - Rhythm practice for all levels - find your level and play or clap along. Videos and downloadable exercises</li>
</ul><br>
  So for a trial run this week I would like to use this schedule for a Google Meet. If this works for everyone I would like to keep this schedule each week:
  
  <br>Wednesday - St. Rose and Rose City Beginning band @ 1pm
                        St. Rose/Madeleine Int/Adv Band @ 2pm
  <br>Thursday - Rieke Beginning Band @ 1pm
                    Rose City and Rieke Int. Bands @ 2pm
  
  <br>Like I said this will be a trial run to make sure everyone can get into the meeting and learn how to use Google Meet as well as go over the links I shared and some lesson items as well. It will be great to virtually see all our young musicians. I will setup the meeting and send you the links this afternoon. Please let me know if you have any questions.
  
  <br>Sincerely,
  
  <br>Scott Johnston
